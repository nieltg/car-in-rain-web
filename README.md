A car in a raining scene on WebGL which is ported from C/C++ version [here](https://github.com/nieltg/car-in-rain). This project uses quite a lot of shaders for particle effects such as rain and smoke to improve performance and for educational purposes.

This scene can be viewed on [this page](https://nieltg.github.io/car-in-rain-web).
